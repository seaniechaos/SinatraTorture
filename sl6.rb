# SL6. Spotinatra

# In the times of Frank Sinatra, there was no Spotify. People had to see him live, or listen to him through a timetable. Can you imagine to
# live in a time like that? At least there was no Justin Beiber! :)

# Anyway, we woke up today with the strong will of telling Frank Sinatra how music is these days. It would be weird to go to his grave and
# tell him, so we will implement a little web application with Sinatra.

# This web application will have three different routes. The first one will be in the home (‘/‘), will be GET, and will list the songs that
# we have sent to our web application. In the beginning, it will be empty, so nothing will be printed out.

# The second one will be ‘/songs/new’, will be POST, and will have both “name” and “artist” parameters. This will add a new song to our
# internal list of songs, and redirect to home (the first route).

# Finally, when we have sent 10 songs to the system through the second route, instead of being redirected to home, we will be redirected to
# a third route, called ‘/enough’, that shows a warning message, crafted by Sinatra himself, staging that current music, and I quote,
# “IS WORTH F***ING NOTHING”*.

# * I am not responsible from Sinatra words. I mean, he said it in his way.
